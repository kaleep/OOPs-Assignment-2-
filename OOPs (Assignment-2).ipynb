    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the abc module stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It provides a way to define abstract classes in Python.

It defines common methods and attributes that should be implemented by its concrete subclasses.\n",

The main purpose of using the abc module is to implement abstraction in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abc module provides the ABC class as the base class for defining abstract base classes. It also provides decorators, such as @abstractmethod and @abstractproperty, to mark methods and properties as abstract.

It allows users to interact with the data without needing to understand its underlying implementation.\n",
